The TRAFFIC Dataset. 

This dataset is introduced in [1] and can be downloaded at http://min.sjtu.edu.cn/lwydemo/Trajectory%20analysis.htm. It contains 300 trajectories collected from a real-world cross-traffic scene. 

We provide the four groups of randomly shuffled indices that are used in our experiments for reproduction.
