The CROSS dataset.

This dataset is part of the Trajectory Analysis Datasets introduced in [1] and can be downloaded at http://cvrr.ucsd.edu/bmorris/datasets/.

The training set contains 1900 traffic trajectory samples divided to 19 classes. The test set has 9700 samples while 200 of them are labeled as anomalous. This dataset is widely used for evaluating trajectory anomaly detection.
